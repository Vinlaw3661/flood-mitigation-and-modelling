## Introduction

Flooding is a significant concern in Washington Township, Bergen County. Our team set out to analyze the factors contributing to flooding and explore mitigation strategies that are both cost-effective and efficient in reducing flood risks. This repository documents our research process, methods, and results.

## Research Methodology

### ArcGIS Analysis

We utilized ArcGIS to study the bathymetry, land use, and vegetation cover of the township. This analysis helped us understand the topography and land characteristics that contribute to flooding. Our findings were compiled into an [ArcGIS Story Map](https://vinlaw3661.github.io/Flooding-Research-Story-Map/) to visually communicate our results.

### Plant Species Identification

As part of our flood mitigation strategy, we identified plant species suitable for replacing traditional lawns. These plants were selected for their ability to absorb water more effectively, reducing runoff and helping to mitigate flood risks.

### SCS Runoff Calculations

We performed SCS runoff calculations using the curve number model to estimate the potential for flooding in different areas of the township. This model helped us quantify the impact of land use changes on runoff and flood risk.

### Flood Mitigation Optimization

Using the results from our runoff calculations, we optimized our flood mitigation strategy to minimize costs while maximizing the total water drained. This involved evaluating various mitigation measures and selecting those that offered the best balance between effectiveness and cost.

### Disaster Risk Heatmap

A heatmap was created in Python to identify and localize disaster risk areas within the township. This heatmap highlights zones with the highest frequency and severity of flooding, allowing for targeted mitigation efforts.
